# The Xyce&trade; Regression Test Suite

This is the test suite associated with the [Xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov)
analog circuit simulator, in this GitHub project (<https://github.com/Xyce>).
The documentation for how to use this test suite is available on the [Xyce
Homepage](https://xyce.sandia.gov) at
<https://xyce.sandia.gov/documentation/RunningTheTests.html>.

The Xyce Regression Suite contains hundreds of tests intended to demonstrate
correct functioning of Xyce on any platform. In addition to basic function
tests, the suite also contains test cases designed to verify that particular
bugs have been fixed, and to ensure they don't get re-introduced. These tests
are run nightly on all our supported platforms, and also by Xyce developers in
the course of their work.

## About Xyce

[Xyce](https://xyce.sandia.gov) (z&#x012B;s, rhymes with "spice") is an open
source, SPICE-compatible, high-performance analog circuit simulator, capable of
solving extremely large circuit problems by supporting large-scale parallel
computing platforms. It also supports serial execution on all common desktop
platforms, and small-scale parallel runs on Unix-like systems. In addition to
analog electronic simulation, Xyce has also been used to investigate more
general network systems, such as neural networks and power grids. In providing
an Open Source version of Xyce to the external community, Sandia hopes to
contribute a robust and modern electronic simulator to users and researchers in
the field.

The Xyce repository is available on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/Xyce/Xyce).

## Contributing

We welcome bug reports and enhancement requests. Those can be done through the
GitHub "Issues" area, or [other
methods](https://xyce.sandia.gov/contact_us.html). Due to internal
restrictions, however, it is difficult for us to accept external contributions
at this time, which includes pull requests. Nevertheless, if you would like to
discuss the possibility of a contribution, please contact us.
