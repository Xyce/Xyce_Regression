Title: Enhancement of the .PRINT statement to support V(*)

Eric R. Keiter, 4/25/2012

This test runs a simple inverter, which includes a print statement that uses 
V(*) and I(*).  The point of this test is NOT to insure that the inverter
runs properly, just that it outputs the correct list of variables.  So,
assuming the test runs all the way through, the test ONLY compares the 
*prn header, which include most of the V and I variables, excluding
internal V nodes.
