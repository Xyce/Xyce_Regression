This test is to verify that the time integration option erroroption=1 is
working correctly.  Basically, in verbose time mode the time integrator will
print out the following information:

This is printed whenever you start a break point
ERROROPTION=1:  DeltaT Grow = 1.6
ERROROPTION=1:  DeltaT Cut = 0.125
ERROROPTION=1:  NL MIN = 0
ERROROPTION=1:  NL MAX = 20
ERROROPTION=1:  DELMAX = 1.5e-07

This is printed for every time step
ERROROPTION=1: TimeStepLimitedbyBP = 0/1
ERROROPTION=1: NL Its = 10
ERROROPTION=1: New DeltaT = 0.23456e-6

The last timestep before a break point normally is not controlled by this strategy; instead, it is what left before a break point. And TimeStepLimitedbyBP is used to indicate whether the time step is limited by break point.

The algorithm is supposed to work as follows when erroroption=1 is set:

if (NL MIN) < (NL Its) < (NL MAX) do nothing
if (NL Its) <= (NL MIN) then (New DeltaT) *= (DeltaT Grow)
if (NL Its) >= (NL MAX) then (New DeltaT) *= (DeltaT Cut)
Always enforce:  (New DeltaT) <= (DELMAX)

This test will read the strings above and verify that the computed delta t's
are correct for the algorithm described.
