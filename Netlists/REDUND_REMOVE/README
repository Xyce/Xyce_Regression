Both tests in this directory have a number of "unnecessary" components added to
the netlists to test the '.PREPROCESS REMOVEUNUSED' functionality.  For 
instance, if the lines 

V1 2 2 1
.PREPROCESS REMOVEUNUSED V

are included, Xyce should remove the source V1 from the netlist since both of
the nodes of V1 are the same.  If, however, the preprocess command isn't 
running correctly, and the source V1 does get added, the test *should* exit in 
error since the addition of such a source causes a matrix singularity 
(something like an AMESOS -22 error).
