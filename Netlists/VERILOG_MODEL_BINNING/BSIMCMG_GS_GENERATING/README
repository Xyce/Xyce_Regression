The netlists and model cards here are used only for generation of the gold
standards for the bsimcmg binning tests.  They are the same circuit, but
use only the correct model card and no binning.  Run them, then rename their
.prn files to the name of the associated test in the directory above, then
move them to the OUTPUT directory.

The level 107 gold standard is just a copy of the level 108, so there is no
circuit to generate it.  110 and 108 do not produce the same signals, so
need separate gold standards.
