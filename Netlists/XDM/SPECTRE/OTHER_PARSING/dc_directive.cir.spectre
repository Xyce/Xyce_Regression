// dc directive
// Netlist tests XDM will properly translate the dc
// directive in Spectre into Xyce. A nuance of this
// test is that XDM should properly translate the 
// swept device name in the dc directive. Since Spectre
// sources aren't identified by the first character
// as in other SPICE languages, XDM will rename sources
// to start with "I" or "V" depending on if it is a
// current or voltage source, respectively. The changed
// source name needs to be reflected in the dc directive.
// See issues #144 and #148 on XDM gitlab
