* solution dependent resistors
* Xyce netlist for corresponding HSPICE netlist.
* This netlist tests XDM is capable of recognizing
* analog behavioral modeling resistors, and specifically
* the case when the ABM expression involves the 
* V(<node name>) and V(<node name>, <node name>) 
* constructs. The translation should then transform
* these resistors to B-elements with a current
* expression. The expression should be the voltage
* across the resistor nodes divided by the resistance.
