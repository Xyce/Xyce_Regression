BUG 1301 test case

The inital problem behind bug 1301 was that printing a voltage difference
from the PRINT line with the syntax:

.print v(node1, node2)

would fail in parallel.  

This failure occurred when node1 and node2 were not on the same processor.

The test for fixing this bug is a large RLC circuit where we print the voltage 
difference between the first node and most of the other nodes in this circuit
of about 900 nodes.  This gives us a very good chance that the two nodes 
involved in the voltage difference do not lie on the same processor.

Thus, all the script for this test does is to check that Xyce ran without 
exiting with an error.
