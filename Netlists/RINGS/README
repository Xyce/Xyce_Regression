Description:  

This directory contains a perl script which can be used to create a bsim3
oscillator of arbitrary length.  The usage is :

ring_osc.pl  <number>  > ring_number.cir <return>


Where the argument "number" is the number of inverters. This number must be
odd, not even for this circuit to function as an oscillator.

This circuit is very similar to the circuit ring_osc.cir, which can be found
in several places in the test suite.  The original circuit is a 17-stage
BSIM3 (or BSIM4) oscillator that originally came with the berkeley BSIM
test suites.
