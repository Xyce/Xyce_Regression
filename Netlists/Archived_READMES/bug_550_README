Test netlists: none 
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_2.1
 
Description:
============
Bug 550 reported that a core dump would happen if the CJO level=3 diode
model paremter was set to zero.  This happened on linux, but not on
other platforms (that I tested).  The original report was for linux.

Procedure:
============
The circuit which was attached to the bugzilla issue should work fine
as a test circuit.  It didn't take very long to run.  This circuit has
been placed in this directory, and is named "bug550.cir".

Verification:
=============
Run bug550.cir on linux in serial.  Don't bother with parallel or any
other platform.  If it finishes without a coredump, consider this bugfix
verified.
