NOTES:
  Bug 374 addresses a problem with device model being specified before
  the primary parameter value.  The Xyce resistor and capacitor are 
  examples of this.  

HOWTO: (no compare)
  1) Xyce capacitor.cir  (does not have the problem line)
  2) Xyce capacitor-bug.cir  (has the problem line)
  3) Confirm that both run to completion without aborting with an error 
     message about unknown (or extra) parameters. 
  *) May be repeated with the resistor example

SERIAL/PARALLEL:
  This test should be run in SERIAL.
