Description:
=======
Bug 224 involves handling of functions declared inside subcircuits. The intial bug report is insufficiently detailed to determine, after the fact, what it was that was going wrong before..

Procedure:
=======

Run both netlists (bug_223_baseline.cir and bug_223_demonstration.cir). Compare the output on bug_223_demonstration.cir to that of bug_223_baseline.cir using xyce_verify.pl.

	Runxyce bug_223_baseline.cir
	Runxyce bug_223_demonstartion.cir
	Xyce_verify.pl bug_223_baseeline.cir bug_223_baseline.cir.prn \
          		Bug_223_demonstration.cir.prn

Verification:
=========
Passes if Xyce and xyc_verify.pl return a 0 exit code.
