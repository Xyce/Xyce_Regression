Test Name: BUG_536
Owner: Eric Keiter
Test netlists: bug536.cir
GS files: bug536.cir.prn
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  xyce_verify.pl
Version of Xyce: Release_2.1
 
Description:
============
Bug 536 reported a problem that applied to the internal workings of
several semiconductor device models.  This problem had to do with
the "MODEINITJCT" flag, which has to do with the manner in which
junction voltages are initialized.  It was not being handled properly 
for sweeps.

A circuit was attached (by Albert Nunez) which caused this error.  This
is a good test to use for certification - it doesn't take long to run.  It
sweeps through 50 values and has about 5 devices.

Procedure:
============

Run the circuit bug536.cir.  Compare with the gold standard output data 
(bug536.cir.prn.gs).  This circuit is too small for parallel, so only do 
this in serial.

Verification:
=============

On each platform, Xyce should exit with a 0 exit code and xyce_verify.pl
should exit with no warnings and with exit code 0.

Notes:
