The gain-stagesoi_default_spice.cir circuit is not run as part of this test.  
It was run in spice3 to generate the gold standard that is used for it.

This is not what we normally do; regression test gold standards are nearly
always generated from previous Xyce versions.  However, this test is
in place to certify Bug 244, which was entitled, 

"The defaults in Xyce bsimsoi do not match defaults in spice3 bsimsoi"
