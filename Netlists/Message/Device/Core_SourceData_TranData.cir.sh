# If Xyce succeeds, but the test fails, then we return exit code 2.

# responsible for capturing any error output from Xyce and the STDOUT & STDERR
# from the comparison program.  The outside script, run_xyce_regression,
# expects the STDERR output from Xyce to go into $CIRFILE.err, the STDOUT
# output from comparison to go into $CIRFILE.prn.out and the STDERR output from
# comparison to go into $CIRFILE.prn.err.
