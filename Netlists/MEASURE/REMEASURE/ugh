This file is used to test how remeasure handles a file name
that it too "short" to be parsed as a valid remeasure file.
The issue is that the filename must end in .PRN, .CSV or .CSD
for the remeasure function to know which file-parsing object
to use.  The file name is specifed with -remeasure <filename>
on the command line.
