The re-measure subdirectory contains tests that
are specific to the "machinery" of re-measure that
are common to all measures.  This includes parsing of
alternate file formats (like .csd) and error handling
for bad Xyce -remeasure lines.

The re-measure of individual measures is typically
covered in the unit tests (e.g, for AVERAGE) in
either MEASURE or MEASURE/STEP.
