This file is used to test how the ERROR measure handles 
a file name that it too "short" to be parsed as a valid 
comparison-file name.  The issue is that the filename must 
end in .PRN, .CSV or .CSD for the ERROR measure function to 
know which file-parsing object to use. That qualifier is 
specified with FILE= on the ERROR measure line.
