This directory holds a set of noise test for Verilog-A derived models.

In all cases, the "gold standards" are Xyce output that have been
manually cross-checked against HSPICE output using the same verilog
(but the original versions unmodified for Xyce) and an equivalent
netlist.

An important "gotcha" in doing this Xyce/HSPICE comparison
is to make sure to run both simulators at the same temperature.
Xyce's default temperature is 27, HSPICE's is 25.  One or the other
simulator must be given a non-default temperature setting.  It is
probably best to do the temperature setting in both netlists to make
it really obvious you're using the same temperature.
