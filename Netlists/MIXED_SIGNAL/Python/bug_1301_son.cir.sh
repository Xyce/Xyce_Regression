# $ARGV[2] = location of compare script

# If Xyce does not produce a prn file, then we return exit code 10.
# If Xyce succeeds, but the test fails, then we return exit code 2.
# If the shell script fails for some reason, then we return exit code 1.
# Otherwise we return the exit code of compare or xyce_verify.pl

# Since the shell script runs Xyce and the comparison program, it is
# responsible for capturing any error output from Xyce and the STDOUT & STDERR
# from the comparison program.  The outside script, run_xyce_regression,
# expects the STDERR output from Xyce to go into $CIRFILE.err, the STDOUT
# output from comparison to go into $CIRFILE.prn.out and the STDERR output from
# comparison to go into $CIRFILE.prn.err.
