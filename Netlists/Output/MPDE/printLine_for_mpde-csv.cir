* This "circuit" exists to provide a meaningful .PRINT line to xyce_verify.pl.
*
* It isn't supposed to be run, and will exit with error.  Also the .PRINT lines
* are missing the expression braces because of a limitation in how convertToPrn.py
* works.  The "gold standard" has been similarly modified.
