The output tests are implemented to validate the wide variety of format
for analysis and ancillary operators generated during the processing of
a circuit model.

Output is described by the .PRINT options, but controlled by the
variety of analysis types.  However, under a variety of circumstances,
additional output is generated by the non-linear solver

The .STEP options also put a spin on things.....


Formatters:

        Prn (standard results output)   .prn

        Raw (binary output)             .raw
        RawASCII (dense ASCII output)   .raw-ascii
        Probe (i dunno)                 .csd
