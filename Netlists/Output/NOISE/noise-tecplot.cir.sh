# $2 = location of xyce_verify.pl script
# $3 = location of compare script 
# $4 = location of circuit file to test
# $5 = location of gold standard prn file

# If Xyce does not produce a prn file, then we return exit code 10.
# If Xyce succeeds, but the test fails, then we return exit code 2.
# If the shell script fails for some reason, then we return exit code 1.
# Otherwise we return the exit code of compare or xyce_verify.pl

# Since the shell script runs Xyce also, it is responsible for capturing any
# error output from Xyce.  The script run_xyce_regression captures the test
# output and handles the resulting files.
