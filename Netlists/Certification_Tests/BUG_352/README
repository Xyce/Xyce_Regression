Description
===========

Some time after Release 1.1 a bug was introduced into the parser that broke
expression handling when parameters in a .model statement were given as
expressions.  Bug 352 documents that failure.  This test verifies that it's
corrected.

The failure was that parameters given as expressions were passed to the device
as unevaluated expressions, and when "dVal" was used to return the double-
precision value, the code gave the device 0.0.

Verification
============
Run both BUG_352a.cir and BUG_352b.cir.  The former uses an expression, the
latter a hardcoded value.  The two should match exactly when compared with
xyce_verify:

    xyce_verify.pl BUG_352b.cir BUG_352b.cir.prn BUG_352a.cir.prn

Release 1.1 of the code worked properly, the failure is only in some post
release 1.1 development snapshots.
