Bug Number: 67
Test netlist: bug_67.cir

Description:
============
This test checks that Xyce aborts cleanly when a B source contains
an expression with syntax errors.

Verification
============
Xyce should abort when run on the netlist with the message:

User Fatal: Unable to parse expression: POLY I(V6) 300U 1


*** Xyce Abort ***

Special Notes:
==============
Parallel testing is not needed.
