This test case verifies that the code can catch badly formatted
piecewise linear functions before devices that depend on them (I and V sources)
are created.  

The netlist Bad_PWL_Source.cir has an error that Xyce should catch and emit an 
error.  The error string is searched for by the controlling script Bad_PWL_Source.cir.sh.
