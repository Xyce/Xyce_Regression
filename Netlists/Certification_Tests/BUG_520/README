Test Name: BUG_520
Owner: Eric Keiter
Test netlists: none 
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_2.1
 
Description:
============
Bug 520 is a PDE device bug, and concerns one of the default dopings 
avaible to 2D PDE devices.  Specifically, the setting of type=PMOS
is the thing being tested, for the case of a PDE device with 4 electrodes.

The output file of interest is FET1_data.txt.  It contains a bunch of
mesh-based information, such as maximum potential (see notes, below).
This file should be compared against the gold standard using "diff".

Another output file is the FET1_000Gnu.dat file.  Do not use this for
certification.  It is a file which contains 2D plot data, suitable
for plotting in gnuplot.  If you run "gnuplot" from the command line, and
then, type:  splot 'Z1_000Gnu.dat' w l <return> you should get a 
pretty cool picture on the screen.  There is no comparator that can
be applied to this type of file, but I am leaving it here for historical
reasons

Procedure:
============
Run the circuit bug520.cir on all platforms, in serial.  
Compare the output of FET1_data.txt  to the gold standard, using
diff.  If there are no differences, then it passes.

Verification:
=============
If "diff" reports no differences, then this test passes.

==================
In an earlier version of this test, no *.prn file was generated, but 
Xyce appears to have been changed to exit with a fatal error if there
is no .PRINT statement.  So, the netlist has been modified to output
a *prn file, but I don't think it is relevant to the test.

Also, in previous versions of the test nox=0.  As nox is the official
default solver, the circuit has been changed so nox=1. (actually the nox= 
line has been removed altogether).


2/9/2006 erkeite:
==================

Modified so that it now outputs
a *txt file (FET1_data.txt) that contains simple information about
the mesh-based variables.  Specifically it contains:

max potential
min potential
max electron density
min electron density
max hole density
min hole density

potential, current, charge, dIdV and dQdV at each electrode.  In this
device there are 4 electrodes:  SOURCE, GATE, DRAIN, SUB.

The output precision is fairly low (5 digits)  for this file, so I'm
hoping it can be compared with "diff".  This is the file that
should be used for verifying the bug.

Note:  Xyce can now run with no print statement again. (see previous notes)

10/27/2007 erkeite:
==================

Modified the linsol line from:

.options LINSOL type=klu 

to be:

.options LINSOL type=klu TR_partition=0 TR_amd=0

TR_partition=0 turns off zoltan, which isn't needed if we are using KLU in parallel.
(in parallel zoltan is called by default).  TR_amd=0 turns off amd reordering, which is
not necessary because klu does this already.

I have also added 'klu' to the tags file, so that this test is only run once, as part 
of the forced "klu"  parallel tests.  Without this, the test is run 2x, which is redundant.

1/31/2012 hkthorn:
=================

Removed ".options LINSOL" line to avoid confusion, since "required:klu" is already in
the tags file.  By default, the transform interface turns off AMD ordering and partitioning
if a serial direct solver is chosen for a parallel run.
