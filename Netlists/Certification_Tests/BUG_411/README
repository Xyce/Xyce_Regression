Description:
============
bug 411:  Segmentation fault when parsing netlist with subcircuit usage error

Proper error trapping was missing prior to this bug fix.  The correction will
now report an error when the subcircuit call, and subcircuit definition
node list lengths, differ.

Procedure:
============
Run Xyce with the perl-generated.cir 

File I/O is handled on proc 0, so parallel test is not necessary.

Verification:
=============
Verify that Xyce does not segfault, particularly on linux and ppc. 

Xyce should abort with an error message.
