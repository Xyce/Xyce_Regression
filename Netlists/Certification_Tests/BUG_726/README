Test Name: BUG_726 
Owner: Eric Rankin
Test netlists: adjacent.cir
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial and Parallel 
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_3.0
 
Description:
============
Xyce failed to recognize improperly concatenated K lines.  It would simply run
to completion producing incorrect results. 
 
Procedure:
============
  runxyce adjacent.cir
    or
  xmpirun -np 2 adjacent.cir 

Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce exits with a message indicating that there a syntax error
with a K device line.

Notes:
======
Testing against valid K lines is covered by the regression tests.  

This test covers >=2, linear, nonlinear, and mixed concatenations since 
the type of mutual inductor is irrelevant this early during parsing.
