# Notes on what this test does:
#
# This script runs two variantes of test circuit bug461.cir in 4 ways:
#  1. bug461_printFormatRaw.cir with ".print format=raw" in ascii raw mode 
#     The raw file is saved as bug269_printFormatRaw.cir.ascii.raw
#  2. bug461_printFormatRaw.cir with ".print format=raw" in binary raw mode 
#     The raw file is saved as bug269_printFormatRaw.cir.raw
#  3. bug461.cir with the command line option "-a -r" to generate an ascii raw 
#     output file containing all of the simulation data.
#  4. bug461.cir with the command line option "-r" to generate a binary raw 
#     output file containing all of the simulation data.

#  Then a similar pair of netlists are run that have
#  ".options output outputversioninrawfile=true"  in the netlist (in the
#  same 4 variations as above to test ascii and binary raw as well as
#  print line vs command line raw).

# After all those runs the following RAW files are checked for the
# version string:
#
# bug_461_printFormatRaw.cir.ascii.raw
# bug_461_printFormatRaw.cir.aw
# bug_461.cir.ascii.raw
# bug_461.cir.raw
#
#
# bug_461_printFormatRaw_versionOn.cir.ascii.raw
# bug_461_printFormatRaw_versionOn.cir.aw
# bug_461.cir.ascii_versionOn.raw
# bug_461.cir_versionOn.raw
#

# The input arguments to this script are:
# $ARGV[0] = location of Xyce binary
# $ARGV[1] = location of xyce_verify.pl script
# $ARGV[2] = location of compare script 
# $ARGV[3] = location of circuit file to test
# $ARGV[4] = location of gold standard prn file

# If Xyce does not produce a prn file, then we return exit code 10.
# If Xyce succeeds, but the test fails, then we return exit code 2.
# If the shell script fails for some reason, then we return exit code 1.
# Otherwise we return the exit code of compare or xyce_verify.pl

# Since the shell script runs Xyce and the comparison program, it is
# responsible for capturing any error output from Xyce and the STDOUT & STDERR
# from the comparison program.  The outside script, run_xyce_regression,
# expects the STDERR output from Xyce to go into $CIRFILE.err, the STDOUT
# output from comparison to go into $CIRFILE.prn.out and the STDERR output from
# comparison to go into $CIRFILE.prn.err.
