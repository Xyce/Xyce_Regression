Test Name: bug_387
Owner: Eric Rankin 
Test netlists: pnp.cir

Comparator: none
Version of Xyce: Release_2.0
 
Description:
============
bug 387:  Xyce segfaults if run on netlist that includes "LPNP" type 
transistor model

The only difference between pnp.cir and lpnp.cir is the model name.  This
test ensures model lookups succeed (PNP is valid), and missing model
types (LPNP is invalid) generate an error message without segfaulting.
  
Procedure:
============
  runxyce pnp.cir
  runxyce lpnp.cir

Verification:
=============
Passes if 
  Xyce runs to completion for pnp.cir
and
  lpnp.cir does not segfault and aborts with an error message similar
  to "Dev Fatal: The model type LPNP is not supported in Xyce"

 
Notes:
