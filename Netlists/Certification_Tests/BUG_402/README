Bug Number: 402
Test netlist: (none)

Description:
============
This bug deals with evaluating the default of linesearch=2 for
transient nonlinear solver.  

Changed the default for the transient nonlinear solver from
searchmethod=2 to searchmethod=0.  This default was really bad in
terms of theory.  The transient defaults enabled both voltage limiting
and quadratic line search.  If a line search was enabled, it would
automatically fail because voltage limiting screwed up the residual
evaluations.  Essentially the line search would always fail out and
take the default step (limiting the backtracking to 2 inner iterations
actually sitll worked because the step wasn't too small as to alert the
user to a problem).

No test since this only changed the default behavior of all circuits.
Test suite passed without a problem.

Verification
============
None.

Special Notes:
==============
None.
