Test Name: BUG_574
Owner: Eric Keiter
Test netlists: bug_574_mpi.cir 
GS files: bug_574_mpi.cir.prn
Mode:  Parallel
Comparator:  xyce_verify.pl
Version of Xyce: Release_2.1
 
Description:
============
Bug 574 requested that the expression capability be added to the .PRINT
line.  This way, it should be possible to specify things like:

.PRINT DC format=tecplot V(1)  I(Vsrc)  {V(1)**2.0}

where the final item in the example is an expression, applied to other
solution variables.

Procedure:
============

There is a nightly regression test associated with this capability.  That
test is expPrint.cir.  This test can be used in part to verify this bug.

On parallel platforms, run the circuit bug_574_mpi.cir. (2 processors is
enough).  Compare the resulting *prn file with 
../../OutputData/BUG_574/bug_574_mpi.cir.prn.  This comparison can be
done with xyce_verify.pl.


Verification:
=============

If expPrint.cir passes the regression test on every serial platform, 
consider this bugfix verified for serial.

If bug_574_mpi.cir passes on every parallel platform, consider this bugfix
verified for parallel.
 
Notes:
======

I tried using expPrint.cir (the regression test circuit) and it bombed in
parallel, even if I tried to use KLU.  I think there is a bugzilla issue
for handling the running of extra small circuits in parallel.  Anyway,
that is why I set up a different circuit for parallel.
