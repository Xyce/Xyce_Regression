Test Name: BUG_1377
Owner: Tom Russo
Test netlists: test1.X.cir
GS files: test1.X.cir.prn
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_4.0.2
 
Description:
============
In versions of Xyce prior to Release 4.0.2, integer instance parameters were
not properly substituted in subcircuits in the same way that double precision
parameters were substituted.  The reason was that the code handling parameters
that were defined as integers was never updated to allow those parameters
to be expressions when the capability was added.

Procedure: 
============ 

Run the test1.X.cir netlist in the normal manner.

Verification:
=============

Compare with the default comparison technique (xyce_verify) to the
gold standard (which was generated with SPICE3F5).
