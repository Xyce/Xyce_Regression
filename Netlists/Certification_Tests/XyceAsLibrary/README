This test is designed to check linking to Xyce as a library for 
mixed signal simulations.  The binary program for this test
is in the Xyce repository and can be built by going to:

Xyce/test/XyceAsLibrary

and typeing "make" to build the test program.  Then run the program
on the netlist in this directory.

This test covers the following BUGS:

BUG 1466 simulateUntil() fails to return upon change
BUG 1467 ADC and DAC are not new DAE compatible
BUG 1499 Use raw names for ADC and DAC devices
BUG 1500 Breakpoint needed at end of ramp


How to run this test:

1) In the Xyce build directory go to "test/XyceAsLibrary" and type make

2) Run the resulting program on this netlist:
   XyceLibTest ADC_DACtest.cir ; echo $?
   
3) if the exit code is 0, then the test passes.
