Description:
============
bug 186:  Make Xyce compile-able and callable as a library

Procedure:
============
configure && make && make install

Verification:
=============
"make install" will create in the $prefix directory
  $prefix/bin/Xyce
  $prefix/lib/libxyce.la

Windows builds may not have libxyce.la, however, the same stub
and static object (libxyce.a) are used to create bin/Xyce

Notes:
======
A successful configure and make confirms this bug is fixed because
the default Xyce executable is constructed from libtoolized objects.
