Test Name: BUG_967 
Owner: elranki 
Test netlists: bug_967.cir
GS files:  none
Mode:  Serial and Parallel 
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_3.1 

NOTE:  As of 4/1/2013, bug_967.cir has been disabled due to bug 1152, where device
and node names are allowed to be the same.
 
Description:
============
Xyce did not recognize device and nodes with the same name, which caused 
various problems.

This test confirms that Xyce can properly handle this scenario by trapping
identical device/node names and reporting an error msg.
 
Procedure:
============
run_xyce bug_967.cir 
  or
xmpirun -np 2  bug_967.cir

Note the error message that is printed.

Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce shows a message similar to "Device name: RBAD is identical 
to a node name".
