Version of Xyce: Release_2.1
 
Description:
============
The title of Bug 529 is "Inconsistent settings of temperature defaults".

This was entirely in Xyce options metadata.  And, in fact, the defaults
for this particular metadata isn't actually used by the code  So, there
isn't any way to test this via code execution.  The main point of the 
metadata defaults (in this case) was to provide an example for users.  In
a sense, this was a documentation bug.

Procedure:
============

Don't do anything.  In fixing this bug I verified by inspection that
the metadata is now correct.

Verification:
=============
I have already checked the metadata in closing this bug, thus verifying
its closure.  No further work is needed.
