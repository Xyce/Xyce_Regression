Description:
============
bug 605  Parallel Xyce hanging on some platforms when run with -v

On some platforms (eg linux_MPILAM), parallel Xyce would hang if
the "-v" or "-h" option is used, and more than one processor.

Procedure:
============
Do not use the xmpirun script.

  mpirun -np 2 $prefix/bin/Xyce -v

Verification:
=============
The version stringshould print and Xyce will exit.

Successfully executing a parallel run of Xyce on more than 1
processor with the "-v" or "-h" option confirms fix.
 
Notes:
======
Use the platform mpi execution call in place of mpirun where
appropriate.  For example, on the Alpha this is "dmpirun".

The "-np" option can be any positive number up to the limits
of the system.

It may be good to run with "-np 1" to confirm the normal case
still works.
