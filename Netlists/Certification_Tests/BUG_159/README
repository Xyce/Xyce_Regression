In versions of Xyce prior to 1.0.1 the model parameter TNOM was
incorrectly used by the BJT code.  It is supposed to be the "nominal
temperature" in celsius.  Internally, the code expects the temperature
in Kelvin.  Other devices properly convert TNOM to kelvin on reading it in.

Prior to release 1.0.1 the netlist bug_159_1.cir would fail to
converge to the operating point (because it was attempting to run at
T=27C with TNOM specified as 27K, a dramatically different temperature).
bug_159_2.cir produces the same output both pre- and post-1.0.1 because it
doesn't specify TNOM.

In versions of Xyce from 1.0.1 on, both bug_159_1.cir and
bug_159_2.cir produce the same output (bug_159_1.cir specifies
TNOM=27, which is the same as the default value used (without
specifying it) in bug_159_2.cir).

Summary:
  1) Run Xyce on both netlists here
  2) use xyce_verify.pl to compare the two resulting outputs.  They should
     match exactly.

Do not run this netlist in parallel.
