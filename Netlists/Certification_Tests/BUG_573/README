bug 573 expressions and parameters don't work inside of vector-composite.
 
Procedure:
============
The default procedure is:
  run_xyce -o ${OUT_DIR}/userOneD.cir.prn userOneD.cir 
  compare userOneD.cir.prn.gs userOneD.cir.prn 0.02 1.e-6 0.02

This is really a copy of regression test PDE_1D_TRAN that uses expressions
and parameters in place of hardcoded values.  Other than this, everything
is the same.
