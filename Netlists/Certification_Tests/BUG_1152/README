Description:
============
Previous to this release, Xyce did not recognize device and nodes with the same name, 
which caused various problems.  Several test cases were generated to ensure that
Xyce can properly handle this scenario by trapping identical device/node names and 
reporting an error msg (bug 767b.cir).

However, changes to the topology package will now allow device and nodes with the
same name.  So these previous tests are being used to verify that Xyce can simulate
the original circuits that illustrated the issues.

Additionally the bug_1152.cir is a simple RLC test that names both the input voltage
device and node "vin".  Then the print statement uses both the voltage of the node
"vin" and current of the device "vin".  This tests that the I/O package is getting
the correct node from the topology package.
