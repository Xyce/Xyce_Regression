Test Name: BUG_899
Owner: Roger Pawlowski
Test netlists: bug899.cir
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_3.1
 
Description:
============
A DC operating point for a transient run was failing, yet the step was
being accepted and xyce proceeded to transient solves.  The status
tests were not correctly flagging the error.  The return code was
incorrectly set to +4 instead of -4.  This error is now being caught.
 
Procedure: 
============ 
Run the circuit bug899.cir.  This circuit is too small for parallel,
so only do this in serial.

Verification:
=============
The DC Operating point should fail to converge and xyce should quit.  Verify that Xyce exits with the following error:



N_TIA_ControlAlgorithm::transientLoop - DC Operating Point Failed.  Exiting
 transient loop.

Notes:
======
03/15/06 tscoffe:  This test requires that Xyce print verbose output.  When
release binaries are built, they have all verbose flags turned off, so this
test will then start to fail.
