This bug tests that the Trapezoid time integrator
in Xyce (.options timeint method=7 which is the
default for Xyce 5.3 and on) respects requests
for .options initial_interval=  where the 
user is requesting output at specific 
time points.  With the simple circuit
on this bug, Trap would take about 132 time steps
on it's own, but 201 with the specified output 
interval.

The test script bug_256.cir.sh attempts
to ensure that more that 200 time steps
have been taken.

There is a related test in BUG_133
