Test Name: BUG_1284
Owner: Tom Russo
Test netlists: bug_1284_baseline.cir, bug_1284_first.cir, bug_1284_restarted.cir
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  xyce_verify
Version of Xyce: Release_4.0.2
 
Description:
============
Bug 1284 documented a bug in which restart files inappropriately contained
the final "pause breakpoint" of the run that created them --- meaning that it
was not possible for a restarted run to run past the final time of the run
that created the restart file.  

Procedure: 
============ 

Run the baseline netlist, then the "first" netlist, then the "restarted" 
netlist.

Verification:
=============

Test succeeds if the restarted netlist runs to completion, and xyce_verify 
passes the comparison between the restarted and baseline output.  The shell
script in this directory takes care of running the three netlists in the 
right order and doing the comparison appropriately.
