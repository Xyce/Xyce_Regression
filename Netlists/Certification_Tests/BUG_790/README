Description:
============
This check is to make sure that output columns in the .prn file do not merge
when high precision output is generated.
 
Procedure:
============
The default procedure is:
  run_xyce -o ${OUT_DIR}/bug790.cir.prn bug790.cir > ${OUT_DIR}/bug790.cir.log

Verification:
=============
Passes if bug790.cir.prn does not have merged columns.  In other words, there
should be white space between each pair of columns.

Sample of good output:

Index           TIME                 V(DD)                V(IN)               V(BUF)
0       0.000000000000e+00   1.000000000000e+00   2.000000000000e+00   1.381908496764e-11   
1       5.000000000000e-12   1.005000000000e+00   2.000000000000e+00   1.038873368887e-05   
 
Notes:
======
Bug790_long.cir tests to see if the index number (first column) merges into the
first data column when it is greater than 7 digits.  The simulation takes hours
to reach this point.  I would not advocate running this test routinely, but
include the input file for completeness.
