Test Name: BUG_668

Owner: elranki 

Test netlists: 
  bug_668.cir
  bug_668_raw.cir
  bug_668_probe.cir
  bug_668_tecplot.cir

GS files: none

Mode:  Serial 

Comparator:  xyce_verify & diff 

Version of Xyce: Release_4.1

 
Description:
============
Confirm that the output formats (RAW, TECPLOT, STD, PROBE) produce the same 
results.

 
Procedure:
============

Create output files in all of the formats:
  runxyce bug_668.cir 
  runxyce -r bug_668_raw.bin bug_668_raw.cir 
  runxyce -r bug_668_raw.txt -a bug_668_raw.cir 
  runxyce bug_668_probe.cir 
  runxyce bug_668_tecplot.cir 

Translate all of the output files to the std format:

  gnuplotxyce.py -s -o bug_668_< ... >

Confirm that all of the translated output files are identical using diffs:

  diff bug_668_< ... > bug_668_< ... >  

Verify that one of translated files matches the original prn file:

  xyce_verify.pl bug_668.cir bug_668.cir.prn test_bug_668_raw.bin


Verification:
=============
Passes if the tecplot, probe, binary rawfile, and ascii rawfile yield the 
same gnuplotxyce translated results.  Those results must match the std prn
file.

 
Notes:
======
The original bug was to test only probe and tecplot output files.  This has
been extended to cover raw (binary and ascii) output as well.

The python libaries, numpy (Numeric) and gnuplot-py, must be installed.
