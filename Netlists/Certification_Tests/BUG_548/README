Description:
============
Bug 548 requested that there be an error trap to ensure that user-specified
electrodes not overlap.

Procedure:
============
The included circuit (overlap.cir) should be run, in serial on all 
platforms.  Don't bother with parallel.

Verification:
=============
The circuit should exit with a fatal error message.  It should say:

Dev Fatal: Electrodes N2 and N1 overlap

If you get this fatal error, consider the test passed.
