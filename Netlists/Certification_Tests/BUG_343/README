Test Name: 343
Owner:

GS files: bug_343.cir.prn 
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  xyce_verify.pl 
Version of Xyce: Development 21 Apr 05
 
Description:
============

Bug 343 reported a segmentation violation when ".options output
initial_interval=" was used without any subsequent time/timestep
pairs.  This segmentation violation occured only on FreeBSD, and was
due to improper initialization of a data block.  On other platforms
the block was coincidentally initialized to 0 by the compiler.
 
Procedure:
============
  runxyce -o ${OUT_DIR}/bug_343.cir.prn bug_343.cir
  xyce_verify.pl bug343.cir ${GS_DIR}/bug_343.cir.prn ${OUT_DIR}/bug_343.cir.prn 

The real test is that Xyce runs to completion on freebsd and does not
segfault.  The xyce_verify.pl test just makes sure that when it *does*
run to completion it still produces valid results.  This second step
does nothing whatsoever to verify the proper functioning of .OPTIONS
OUTPUT INITIAL_INTERVAL=, but there's no easy way to do that and it's
not part of the bug anyway.
 
Verification:
=============

Test passes if both runxyce and xyce_verify.pl exit with exit code 0
and no error messages.
 
Notes:
======

Per bug 406, this bug test netlist was completely revamped to remove
an inappropriately complex test case.  The change was done on 21 April 2005.
