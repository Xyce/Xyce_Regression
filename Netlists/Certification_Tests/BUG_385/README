Test Name: BUG_385
Owner: Eric Keiter
Test netlists: none 
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_2.1
 
Description:
============
Bug 385 requested that Xyce support PSPICE-style DC options.  This meant
support DEC, OCT and LIST sweeps, in addition to LIN sweeps, which have
always been the supported default in Xyce.

This bug is a subset of bug # 528, which was also fixed.

There are regression tests that cover this bug, so if the regression 
test suit is passing on all platforms this bug should be considered fixed.
 
Procedure:
============
Run nightly regression tests.  Make sure the DC_UPGRADE tests all pass.  They
are:

Xyce_Test/Netlists/DC_UPGRADE/dcOct.cir
Xyce_Test/Netlists/DC_UPGRADE/dcDec.cir
Xyce_Test/Netlists/DC_UPGRADE/dcList.cir

Verification:
=============
Passes if the 3 regression tests pass. 
 
Notes:
======
These 3 regression tests are adequate for this bug (385).

The are  neccessary, but not sufficient, for the duplicate (superset) bug # 528,
which also covers .STEP.
