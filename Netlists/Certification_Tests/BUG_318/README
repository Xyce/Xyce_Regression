Bug Number: 318
Test netlist: bug_318.cir

Description:
============
Bug 318 deals with problems with model scoping rules. Parameterized models
need to be scoped by device instance. This test checks that this happens
properly.

This test compares a netlist that depends on the bug being fixed to a netlist
that has had a workaround implemented to avoid the bug.  If the bug is fixed,
both should agree.

Verification
============
Run Xyce on both the netlists in this directory.

Compare the two results to each other using xyce_verify.pl:

   xyce_verify.pl bug_318.cir bug_318_noscope.cir.prn bug_318.cir.prn

Special Notes:
==============
None.
