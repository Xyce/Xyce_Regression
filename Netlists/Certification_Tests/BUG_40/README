Bug Number: 40
Test netlist: bug_40.cir

Description
===========
The netlist contains a .PRINT statement that attempts to print data for a node
that does not exist in the circuit. 

Verification
============
The following statement should appear in the standard output (given in 
bug_40.out, not the prn file) for this job:

  Dev Warning: Output requested for non-existent node "BAD" by PRINT statement

Special Notes
=============
1. To collect standard output run Xyce as in:

     % Xyce bug_40.cir > bug_40.out

   or
 
     % runxyce -l bug_40.out bug_40.cir

2. The prn file can be ignored since we are testing only for the presence
   of the specifed warning message.

3. No parallel testing is needed.
