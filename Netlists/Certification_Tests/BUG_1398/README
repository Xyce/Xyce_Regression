Test Name: BUG_1398
Owner: Tom Russo
Test netlists: RLC.cir, RLC_simple.cir
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  xyce_verify.pl
Version of Xyce: Release_4.0.2
 
Description:
============
In versions of Xyce prior to Release 4.0.2, but after revision 1.120 of
N_DEV_Inductor.C, Xyce supported a PSpice-like model card for the inductor
that contains a parameter L.  In PSpice, this is meant to be an inductor
multiplier, but in Xyce it has been getting ignored since revision 1.120.
Prior to revision 1.120, it was still wrong, and was simply another way of 
specifying the total inductance.

Procedure: 
============ 

The script "RLC.cir.sh" takes care of it, and runs RLC_simple.cir and RLC.cir.
The former uses no model cards at all, and the latter uses model cards that
should produce identical results.

Verification:
=============

Compare the outputs of RLC_simple.cir and RLC.cir with xyce_verify.pl
