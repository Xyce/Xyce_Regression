Test Name: BUG_654
Owner: Eric Rankin 
Test netlists: macterminator.cir
GS files:  none
Mode:  Serial and Parallel
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_3.0       
 
Description:
============
Xyce does not reach topology stage when reading in a file with with Macintosh 
style line terminators.
 
Procedure:
============
  run_xyce macterminator.cir 
    or
  xmpirun -np 2 macterminator.cir
 
Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce returns a 0 exit code (no error).

Notes:
======
This is a very small circuit, therefore it should run rather quickly on 
all platforms.  If Xyce does not exit within a "resonable" amount of time, 
this is still broken.  (Xyce appears to be running when it is actually hung.)

Be careful to preserve the mac line terminators when tranferring 
macteminator.cir between machines.
