Bug Number: 250
Test netlist: bug_250.cir

Description:
============
This test checks that inline comments are handled correctly when they
occur on a line which is continued on subsequent lines.  This was the
original focus of SRN Bug 250.

This test was updated for SON Bug 955 to also test what happens when 
an "inline comment" is the only thing on a netlist line.  For code 
coverage reasons, it is then important to test that type of inline 
comment line for:

  1) an inline comment line that is followed by a non-comment or
non-continuation line.

  2) two inline comment lines separated by a blank line.

  3) inline comment lines followed by continuation lines.  There are
two cases.  The continuation character (+) is the first character on 
the line, or the continuation line starts with white space.

Verification
============
Run Xyce in serial on the netlist.
Compare against the results in the given prn file using the "compare" 
program.

Special Notes:
==============
Parallel testing is not needed for this case.
