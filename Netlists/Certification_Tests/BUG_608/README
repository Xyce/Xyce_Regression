Description:
============
bug 608  "BUG_281" certification problem enters infinite loop.

On freebsd this bug caused Xyce to enter an infinite loop.  On some other 
platforms, a segfault would result.  This is essentially a duplicate of
BUG_281 (and BUG_204) that was reintroduced with the distributed parser
and changes to .DC handling.

Procedure:
============
None.  BUG_281 covers this.

Verification:
=============
Successful completion of BUG_281 implies this bug is also corrected.
