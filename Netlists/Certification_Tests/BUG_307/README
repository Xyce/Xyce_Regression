Description:
============
BUG 307 related to mishandling of model statements in subcircuit context.
Some time between Release 1.0.1 and the tag D_RELEASE_1_1_0_B, model statements
in subcircuits were added to the global context rather than the subcircuit's,
and this led to the code using the wrong models when subcircuits happened
to have identically named models. In the process of fixing this bug it was
discovered that model prefixing and include file handling needed adjusting,
Also, a warning message was added in the case that multiple models of a
given name appear withing the same context.  All of these cases are tested.

Verification:
=============

   1) Run bug_307_a.cir and bug_307_b.cir

   2) compare the resulting .prn files with xyce_verify.pl.  They should
      be identical, and xyce_verify should exit with a zero exit code and
      no console output.

   3) Run bug_307_d.cir through bug_307_i.cir

   4) Compare the results from (3) using xyce_ferify. Note that the output 
      in each of these cases should be identical on any given platform.

   5) In addition to the results in (4), bug_307_g.cir and bug_307_h.cir
      should produce the follow message in the log file:

      User Warning: Reading model named SW in the subcircuit XX and found one or
      more models previously defined in this scope.

      Where "XX" is one of "ONEBIT", "OR", "AND", or "XOR".

      There will be one such message for every occurrence of the "SW"
      model after the first in these netlists, so there will be 3 in the
      log for bug_307_g.cir and 4 in the log for bug_307_h.cir.

Notes:
======
  1) Parallel testing CANNOT be performed on bug_307_a.cir and bug_307_b.cir.

  2) Parallel testing should be performed on bug_307_d.cir through 
     bug_307_i.cir.

  3) Problems with direct matrix handling currently require this to be
     turned off for the parallel runs, use the "-dma off" flag.
