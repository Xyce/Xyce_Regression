Bug 805 (charleston): Add support for alternate parameter names in BJT model

Many common BJT Gummel-Poon parameters have various aliases, depending
on which SPICE varient one uses.  The point of this bug was to support
as many of these aliases as we could, to be more compatible with Hspice
and Pspice.  Hspice has a lot of params that we don't support, so
it wasn't possible to make things 100% compatible.

See this link for a table of params, and their names in various 
simulators including spice2/3, Pspice, Hspice, and Spectre.

Here are the params I aliased for this bug:

Bf ->   BFM 
Vaf -> VA VA, VBF 
Ikf -> IK IK, JBF 
Ise -> JLE
Ne -> NLE
Br -> BRM
Var -> VB, VRB, BV
Ikr -> JBR
Isc -> JLC
Irb -> JRB, IOB 
Vje -> PE
Mje ->  ME
Vjc -> PC
Mjc -> MC
Xcjc -> CDIS 
Cjs -> CCS CCS, CSUB 
Vjs -> PS PSUB 
Mjs -> MS ESUB 
Itf -> JTF 
Xtb -> TB, TCB
Xti -> PT

All this test will do is run several circuits with identical parameters,
but with different aliases for those params.  The results should pass
the "diff" test.
