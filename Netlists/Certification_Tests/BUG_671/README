Test Name: BUG_671
Owner: Eric Rankin 
Test netlists: vpwl_binaryfile.cir
               include_files:  vpwl-word.csv
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_3.0
 
Description:
============
Xyce Not Producing Error w/wrong file type

The parser failed to warn users and provide a graceful exit if certain csv 
files were improperly formatted.  Binary files, such as Microsoft Word
documents, contain extra characters that caused the parser to segfault.  
 
Procedure:
============
  run_xyce  vpwl_binaryfile.cir 
 
Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce does not segfault and exits with an error message indicating 
a problem with reading the include file.
 
Notes:
======
This test is derived from the vpwl test in the regression suite.  Be careful
to preserve the format of the include file:  it is a Microsoft Word document.
