Bug Number: 311
Test netlists: bug_311_a.cir
               bug_311_b.cir

Description:
============
Bug 311 involved a problem locating models in subcircuits when a device
using one of those models appeared in the netlist after a subcircuit
instance of any kind.

Bugs 307 and 311 arose due to the recent introduction of the Xyce class
N_IO_CircuitContext. This class had not been adequately tested for
possible problems during the context construction and navigaton phases
(roughly pass 1 and pass 2 of the netlist parser, respectively). In
addition to testing bug 311, this test attempts to exercise various
aspects of the N_IO_Circuit class. 

Verification:
=============

   1) Run bug_311_a.cir, bug_311_b.cir

   2) Compare the results using xyce_verify.

   3) The log for bug_311_a.cir should contain the following message:

      Reading model named SW in the subcircuit ONEBIT and found one or more models previously defined in this scope.

Notes:
======
  - Parallel testing should be performed. 
  
  - Problems with direct matrix handling currently require this to be
    turned off for the parallel runs, use the "-dma off" flag.
