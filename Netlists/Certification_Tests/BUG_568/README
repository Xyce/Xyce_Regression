Test Name: BUG_568
Owner: 
Test netlists: bug_568.cir
GS files: bug_568.cir.prn, bug_568.cir.res
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  xyce_verify.pl
Version of Xyce: Release_2.1       
 
Description:
============

Bug 568 related to transmission line devices in netlists with .STEP
directives.  Prior to the fix, transmission lines did not clear their history
when the step loop cycled, leading to bad behavior at the beginning of a 
step.
 
Procedure:
============
Run Xyce on the included netlist:

  runxyce bug_568.cir

It should produce a .prn and a .res file.

Compare the files to the gold standard with xyce_verify.pl:

  xyce_verify.pl --goodres=../../OutputData/BUG_568/bug_568.cir.res \ 
                 --testres=bug_568.cir.res
                 bug_568.cir
                 ../../OutputData/BUG_568/bug_568.cir.prn
                 bug_568.cir.prn

Note that the "../../OutputData/" files are simply examples of how to find the gold
standard versions, and the file names without a path are meant to be examples of what
would be created in the current working directory if the example "runxyce" command
shown above were run with no added flags.  The xyce_verify.pl command might have to be
modified slightly if the run deviates from these assumptions.

Verification:
=============
Xyce should exit with error code 0 (successful run) and  xyce_verify.pl should
also exit with error code 0.  Due to tolerance settings, some warnings that
"Throwing away duplicate time 0" will appear, and are safely ignored.

Notes:
