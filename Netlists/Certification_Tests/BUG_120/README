Bug #120 was a request that Xyce support dtmax, a user-specified maximum
time step (or step ceiling, in the language of the users' guide).  This
parameter is the 4th parameter on a .tran line:

.tran 0.0001MS 20MS 0MS 0.01MS

here:

  The first argument, 0.0001MS is the print interval, or a guess for the
  initial time step.

  The second argument, 20MS is the final time for the simulation.

  The third argument, 0MS is the initial time for the simulation (this is
  an optional argument).

  The fourth argument, 0.01MS is dtmax.

The 3rd argument must be specified for there to be a 4th argument.

Before, Xyce would read in all 4 args, but would ignore the last one.  Now, 
it uses the last one.

The attached netlist is the inductor.cir circuit from the test suite, with
a modified .tran line to include the 3rd and 4th arguments.  Before fixing
bug #120, adding these 2 arguments did not change the behavior of Xyce, and
the circuit would take 95 steps to complete.  Now, with dtmax support, the
same circuit takes 2057 steps to complete.

The *.prn file in this directory is the correct output for the new,
dtmax-supported version of Xyce.
