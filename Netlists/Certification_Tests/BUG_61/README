Bug Number: 61
Test netlist: capacitor.cir

Description:
============
This test checks for the FORMAT=NOINDEX feature.

Verification
============
Run Xyce in serial on the netlist.

Since the format of the prn file differs from what the comparison utilities
expect, they cannot be used in this case. It suffices to examine the
prn file produced and verify that it does NOT have an "Index" column.
The remainder of the data can be ignored.

Special Notes:
==============
Parallel testing is not needed.
