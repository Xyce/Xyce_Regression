Test Name: BUG_1376
Owner: Tom Russo
Test netlists: upper_case.cir
               lower_case.cir
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator:  xyce_verify.pl
Version of Xyce: Release_4.1
 
Description:
============

Until Xyce 4.1, the "ON" and "OFF" parameters for switches and
transistor devices were case-sensitive, and would only work with lower-case spelling
if an "=1" were also provided.  During development of Xyce 4.1 this was 
fixed.

Procedure:
============

The test is controlled by the script bug_1376.cir.sh.  This runs the upper_case.cir
and lower_case.cir tests and compares their results, which should be identical.
 
Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce and xyce_verify.pl return a 0 exit code.  

 
Notes:
