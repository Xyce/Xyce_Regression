Description:
============
bug 612:  MPICH versions of Xyce fail

The "fix" for bug 605 actually broke the MPICH builds.  This happened
because mpich alters the command line arguments each process sees, and
the bug 605 patch ignored these modifications.  Binaries running far
nodes (proc > 0) entered a receive loop, but proc 0 never broadcast
any information, causing the hang.

All mpich builds were affected for all parallel runs with > 2 processors.

Procedure:
============
None.  trans_line, and others, cover this.

Verification:
=============
Successful completion of the trans_line parallel tests imply this bug 
is corrected.
 
Notes:
======
This bug was triggered by the MPICH builds, however modifications to fix
it apply to all parallel versions.  trans_line chosen as the test 
reference only because it is mentioned in the bugzilla report as having
triggered the error.
