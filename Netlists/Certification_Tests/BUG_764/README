Bug Number: 764
Test netlist: none

Description:
============
This test checks that an error is returned when the user tries to run Xyce without
a netlist.

Verification
============
Run Xyce in serial no arguments (just type 'Xyce').

Xyce should exit with fatal error:

User Fatal: Netlist not found on command line

Special Notes:
==============
In parallel type 'mpirun -np 2 Xyce'

Xyce should exit with the same error.

NOTE:  On NWCC, it is possible to invoke "xpirun" with either "-n 2" or 
"-np 2" because of the strange "mpiexec" deal they use there.  The former will 
produce a different error message and the test script will report a failure.
So when running the certification testing on NWCC, be sure to invoke xmpirun 
with the "-np 2" version that all the other platforms like.
