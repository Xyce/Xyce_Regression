Description:
============
Confirms that a Y device with a name also starting with Y is parsed properly.

 
Procedure:
============
  run_xyce bug_1178.cir


Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce runs to completion without error.

 
Notes:
======

Release 3.1.1 fails to reach DCOP.  It also displays the following warnings:

  Dev Warning: Voltage Node (PDEDIODE) connected to only 1 device Terminal
  Dev Warning: Voltage Node (3) connected to only 1 device Terminal


A patch to detect missing nodes (bug 1116) was added between r3.1.1 and the 
current fix (bug 1178).  Instead of these warning messages, Xyce displays
the following fatal error message:

  User Fatal: Error in file bug_1178.cir at or near line
   14
   Insufficient number of nodes for device: Y%PDE%YDIODE
