Bug Number: 624
Test netlist: bug_624.cir

Description:
============
This test checks that an error is returned when the user tries to step a non-existent
parameter.  The original intent had been to test that setParam handled an attempt to
set a non-existent parameter correctly, but investigation revealed that the error
condition was encountered as a result of a call to getParam.  At that time, setParam
was tested by modifying the Xyce source.

Verification
============
Run Xyce in serial on the netlist.

Xyce should exit with fatal error:

User Fatal: Unable to find parameter R1:BOGUS

Special Notes:
==============
Parallel should give the same error.
