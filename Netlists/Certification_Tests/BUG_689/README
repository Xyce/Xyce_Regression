Test Name: BUG_689
Owner: Eric Rankin 
Test netlists: dos-diode.cir
               unix-diode.cir
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial 
Comparator:  diff 
Version of Xyce: Release_3.0
 
Description:
============
Windows builds of Xyce failed to properly parse subcircuit contents if dos
style line terminators were present in the subcircuit.
 
Procedure:
============
runxyce -o dd.out dos-diode.cir 

Note the (absence of a) warning message from the device package regarding 
voltage node(s) connected to only one device terminal.


runxyce -o ud.out unix-diode.cir 

diff ud.out dd.out

 
Verification:
=============
Xyce will run to completion for both circuits. 

Passes if no warning message is shown on stdout and dd.out and ud.out are 
identical.
 
Notes:
======
This bug only affects Windows.

Be careful to preserve Windows line terminators when tranferring dos-diode.cir
between machines.  The unix/linux utility "unix2dos" is helpful for formatting.
