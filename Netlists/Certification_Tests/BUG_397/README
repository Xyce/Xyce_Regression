Test Name: BUG 397
Owner: ???
Test netlists: diode.cir
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial 
Comparator:  diode.cir.sh
Version of Xyce: Release_2.1       # the first version where this bug was tested.
 
Description:
============
  Bug 397 addresses a problem with empty log files.  When the "-l" flag 
  is used, the created log file contains no data and the output is
  sent to stdout, which is usually the monitor.  

Procedure:
============
  1) Xyce -l sample.log diode.cir 
  2) Verify that no output appears on stdout. 
  3) Open the newly created sample.log file.  It should contain the
     data that normally appears on the screen when "-l" is not used.

Notes:
======
  This test should be run in SERIAL only.  

The included script, diode.cir.sh, checks that all the output that
would appear on standard out without the -l flag is placed into the
log file when the -l flag is given.  Because NOX doesn't know about
the -l flag, NOX output that is displayed when Xyce is compiled with
--enable-verbose_nonlinear is sent to standard out whether -l is given
or not.  Therefore this test will *always* fail unless a non-verbose
version of Xyce is used (such as those that are generated for release
purposes).


Note added by ERK, 10/22/2009: 
I have modified this test, slightly to also certify bug 1727 on the 
SRN version of bugzilla (charleston).  That bug was about unwanted,
verbose output, using a non-verbose build of Xyce, that happened 
when running a transient netlist that used erroroption=1 and 
method=7 (trapezoid).    The only reasonable way to test that 
this was fixed was to limit it to non-verbose testing, and to then
do a test very similar to the one done here.  I've modifed the
circuit to be transient, and I've also modified the netlist to
use trapezoid.
