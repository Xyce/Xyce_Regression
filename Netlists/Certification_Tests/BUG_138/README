Bug Number: 138
Test netlist: bug_138_1.cir
              bug_138_2.cir

Description:
============
This test checks for proper handling of E, F, G, and H sources when
they are converted to B-sources.

Verification
============
Run Xyce on each of the netlists bug_138_1.cir and bug_138_2.cir.

Compare against the results in the given prn files using xyce_verify.pl or
"compare".

Special Notes:
==============

Gold standard for bug_138_2.cir.prn had to be changed on 20 October 2004, 
because Xyce will no longer match output with previous versions.  This is
due to changes in the handling of the third .TRAN parameter ("Tstart") between
release 2.0 and release 2.1.  It is impossible to massage the new netlist
to produce the same (broken) output as the old code did.  It is simply
necessary to change what we expect to match.

On 16 Dec 2004, Rob Hoekstra added ".options linsol type=superlu" to
bug_138_2.cir to address convergence failure problems when this
netlist was run on SGI platforms in parallel.  This set of options is
invalid in versions of xyce prior to release 2.1.  No other platform
experienced convergence failures in parallel using AZTEC iterative
solvers, but since solver issues are not the focus of this bug test it
is reasonable to use whatever options are needed to get it to run and
match the gold standard.  The test is a test of parser function only.
