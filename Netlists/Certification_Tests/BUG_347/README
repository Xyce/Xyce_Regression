NOTES:
  Bug 347 addresses a problem Windows users have with running Xyce on 
  a netlist in a directory that has spaces in path.  This occurs when 
  using the runxyce.bat script.

HOWTO: (no compare)
  1) Copy the netlist file to a directory that has spaces in its name,
     such as C:\PATH WITH SPACES\diode.cir 
  2) Using runxyce.bat, try to execute Xyce with the netlist in this
     location.  
       runxyce.bat C:\PATH WITH SPACES\diode.cir
  3) Note there is an error.  The User's Guide indicate that paths
     with spaces must be wrapped in quotes.
        runxyce.bat "C:\PATH WITH SPACES\diode.cir"
  4) Verify that the path with quotes does not generate an error as
     in step (2) above. 

SERIAL/PARALLEL:
  This test should be run in SERIAL on Windows only.  

Notes:  03/15/06 tscoffe:  This test can be performed on Unix too, but there
are some exceptions.  The runxyce script (as written), does not pass parameters
to Xyce with quotes intact, so you can not use files or directories that have
spaces in them with the current runxyce script.  But you can use spaces in
filenames when calling the Xyce binary directly, as long as you put quotes
around the filename.  Under Windows, the runxyce.bat script _does_ pass
arguments with quotes.  When the script for this test is run under XTF, it will
locate the Xyce binary and use that instead, otherwise this test will fail when
it is passed runxyce, as in release testing.   Therefore, this test can be
applied to all platforms before release testing, but then should be limited to
Windows for actual release testing.
