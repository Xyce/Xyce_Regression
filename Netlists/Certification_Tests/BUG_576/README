Description:
============
Bug 576 requested that a divide by zero error be removed from the PDE
devices.  This was an error that only happened on SGI, and I had added
it inadvertantly, when refactoring the current calculation in the PDE
devices.  

Fixing it wasn't that difficult. I had to change some machine-dependent
things.

This bug was noticed when the regression test suite started to fail for
the PDE devices on SGI.  If the PDE tests are all passing on all platforms,
in the regression testing, that should be considered adequate testing
for this bug.
 
Procedure:
============
Run nightly regression tests.  Make sure the 3 PDE tests do not exit with
error.  These 3 tests are:

Xyce_Test/Netlists/PDE_1D_Diode/diopde.cir
Xyce_Test/Netlists/PDE_1D_TRAN/userOneD.cir
Xyce_Test/Netlists/PDE_2D_BJT/cartbjt.cir

Verification:
=============
Passes if the 3 regression tests pass.   Failures related to this bug are
catastrophic - segmentation faults.
