Description:
============

Issue # 460 was about implementing a new feature, .result.  This capability
is only supposed to work if you are running with .step.  At the end of
each .step iteration, the expressions that are specified on a .result line
are calculated, and are included in the *.res file (which is produced as a 
part of .step) in extra columns.  This sort of capability is useful if you
have auxilliary calculations that you want to do, but only at the end of
each transient.

In some respects, testing this capability is fairly easy, in that you need
to:

(1) make sure there are the right number of outputs.
(2) verify that the specified expressions are evaluated correctly.

This should work for multiple .result statments in the netlist.  It should
also work for both serial and parallel.  Finally, it should work for multiple
.STEP sweep variables, and it should flag an error if .result is specified 
without a .step.
