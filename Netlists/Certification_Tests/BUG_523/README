Description:
============
Bug 523 highlighted some buffer overruns in the reading of restart files,
and an incorrect handling of restarted time integrator parameters.
 
Procedure:
============
There is no specific test case for this bug, but proper functioning of any 
netlist that uses restart can serve as verification that bug is fixed.
One such test case is bug 442's test case.

It would be best if a thorough restart testing suite were added to the
regression suite.  

Verification:
=============
This bug is verified if bug 442's test case passes.
