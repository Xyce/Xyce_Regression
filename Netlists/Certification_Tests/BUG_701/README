Test Name: BUG_701
Owner: Eric Rankin 
Test netlists: dup-toplevel.cir

GS files:  none
Mode:  Serial and Parallel
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_3.0 
 
Description:
============
Parser erroneously ignores duplicate device names within a (sub)circuit.
 
Procedure:
============
  runxyce dup-toplevel.cir
  runxyce dup-subcircuit.cir
    or
  xmpirun -np 2 dup-toplevel.cir
  xmpirun -np 2 dup-subcircuit.cir

Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce exits with a fatal error indicating more than one device with
the same name appears within a (sub)circuit.
 
Notes:
======
Devices names may be reused in different subcircuits.  Testing to ensure that 
this still works is covered by existing regression tests.
