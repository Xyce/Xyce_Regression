NOTES:
  Bug 289 is a feature request for the date and to get displayed at 
  the start of a Xyce run.  It is implemented as a part of the 
  execution scripts.

HOWTO: (no compare)
  1) Verify that the date and time are displayed when Xyce is run
     using the execution scripts (runxyce and xmpirun).  The date
     and time will appear just after the copyright notice.  

SERIAL/PARALLEL:
  This test may be run in SERIAL or PARALLEL.  

NOTE:  03/15/06 tscoffe:  This feature is implemented in the "runxyce" script
that actually calls Xyce, so this test will fail when applied to a Xyce binary
directly.
