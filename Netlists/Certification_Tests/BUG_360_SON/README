This test insures that if a netlist fails to converge, it will include in its
queue'd failure output the name of the node that was most problematic to 
the solver.

It tests this by running a circuit that will fail in transient and then doing
a grep using a pattern file that contains all the node names for this circuit.
This grep *should* produce a file that is 25 lines long, one for each failed
history step.
