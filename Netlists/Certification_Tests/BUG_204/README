From the comments in the netlist:
 The bug this is intended to test, bug 204, was one in which any netlist
 with a ".DC" analysis line, which lacked a 3rd parameter to indicate the step
 size, would fail by going into an infinite loop.

 This circuit tests it by having such a .DC statement.  This is the
 "diode" circuit from the test suite, but with the .DC analysis statement
 changed to set up the bug.  Xyce should take this in stride now.

Summary:
  1) Run Xyce on this netlist using the "-op" (old parser) option:
     runxyce -op bug204.cir
  2) If operating correctly, Xyce will take one DC step, and V(1) will be
     5 volts at this step.

Running without the "-op" option will cause Xyce to exit with a fatal error
in the parsing phase because of the missing parameter on the .DC line.

This bug test will ultimately go away --- the new parser flags the
syntax error that it contains as an error, whereas the bug test tests
the ability of the code to handle the syntax error when the OLD parser
passed over the syntax error and passed incomplete data to the time
integration package.  Some day the old parser will go away, and this
bug test will become irrelevant (except, perhaps, as a test of the new
parser's error reporting capabilities).
