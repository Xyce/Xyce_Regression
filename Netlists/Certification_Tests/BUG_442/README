Description:
============

Bug 442 called for the implementation of restart capability on devices
with history, specifically the Transmission line.  It also exposed an
incomplete implementation of "unpacked" restart files that are
required on windows platforms and available on all platforms.
 
Procedure:
============
Run the baseline netlists:
   runxyce bug_442_baseline.cir
   runxyce bug_442_baseline_unpacked.cir
This will create restart files that the restarted netlists try to use:
   runxyce bug_442_restarted.cir
   runxyce bug_442_restarted_unpacked.cir

Run xyce_verify.pl on the two resulting output files:
   xyce_verify.pl bug_442_baseline.cir bug_442_baseline.cir.prn bug_442_restarted.cir.prn
   xyce_verify.pl bug_442_baseline_unpacked.cir bug_442_baseline_unpacked.cir.prn bug_442_restarted_unpacked.cir.prn

It should also be the case that the restarted output generated from
packed and unpacked files should match:

   xyce_verify.pl bug_442_restarted.cir bug_442_restarted.cir.prn bug_442_restarted_unpacked.cir.prn

Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce and xyce_verify.pl return a 0 exit code.  
 
Notes:
======
The final step relies on xyce_verify's ability to interpolate the baseline 
solution to only the points contained in the test case.  Since the restarted
output starts at a later time than the baseline does, but they should match
exactly for all the times in the restarted run, that's OK.

On Windows platforms (only!), the unpacked test is redundant because on
this platform restarts are always unpacked.  Therefore
"bug_442_*_unpacked.cir" need not be run on windows, and the final
comparison between restarted outputs is unnecessary and meaningless.
