The following is no longer the case.  The new output manager is designed
to allow multiple concurrent output files to be generated in a single
run.

--
This is a test case for BUG 1847 where a ".print" line 
that specified RAW format in an include file and before 
the ".print" line in the main file would cause Xyce to 
create a RAW file with all of the simulation data (i.e.
a RAWOverride in the new Outputter class).  This no
longer happens thanks to Dave's refactor of the Output
Manager.  

This test sets up the same series of .print lines as
reported in the bug case, runs them in Xyce and 
then verifies that (1) no Raw file was generated
and (2) that the "prn" file that was made has the
right header and values by comparing to a gold 
standard.  This way if something changes in the 
Outputter class and we start respecting the
extra .print line this test will fail.   

At this time Xyce doesn't support multiple 
.print lines so it just does what the last
.print line it encountered says.  This 
test verifies that behavior.  If we change
Xyce's behavior later on, this test will 
have to change.
