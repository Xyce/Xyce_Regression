Test Name: BUG_1578
Owner:  Tom Russo
Test netlists: bug_1578.cir
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator: none 
Version of Xyce: Release_4.1       # the first version where this bug was tested.
 
Description:
============

This test verifies that Xyce prints a reasonable, descriptive, and helpful error message 
when Xyce encounters a netlist line with an illegal device type (i.e. a line with an invalid 
first character).  Prior to the fix of bug 1578, Xyce simply printed "defaultModel not 
implemented for this device" with no indication of what device, what part of the netlist, 
or anything else.

 
Procedure:
============

Run Xyce on the netlist using the supplied perl script through run_xyce_regression.  The
perl script runs the netlist and checks that the error message:
  User Fatal: Error in file bug_1578.cir at or near line 10
   Invalid device type for device NETLIST
is printed.

To run by hand, just run Xyce on the supplied netlist and check for the presence of that
error message.
 
Verification:
=============
Test passes if the error message is as described in Procedure.  Fails if Xyce prints
"defaultModel not implemented for this device."
