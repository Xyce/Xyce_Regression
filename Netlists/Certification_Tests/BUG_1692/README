Test Name: bug_1692
Owner: Eric Keiter, with some code written by Dave Shirley.

Test netlists:  see below
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial
Comparator: diff       
Version of Xyce: Release_5.0 
 
Description:
============
This test confirms that under some circumstances, expressions can be specified 
without curly braces or single quotes surrounding them.  As of this writing
(5/21/2009), the conditions under which this can be done include:

1) no whitespace in the expression

2) equals sign must be present.

3) Other than .MODEL, any line starting with "." is excluded from this 
capability, meaning that expressions in lines such as .PRINT won't work 
without braces or quotes.

Procedure:
============
  run_xyce bug_1692_0.cir
  run_xyce bug_1692_1.cir
  run_xyce bug_1692_2.cir
  run_xyce bug_1692_3.cir
  diff bug_1692_0.cir.prn against the other 3.

 
Verification:
=============
Passes if the output is identical.
