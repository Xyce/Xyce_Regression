Test netlists: extra-space.cir
               bad-device-line.cir
               worse-device-line.cir
GS files: none
Mode:  Serial and Parallel (Do not test linux_MPICH or alpha_osf1_MPI)
Comparator: none
Version of Xyce: Release_2.0
 
Description:
============
Bug 401:  Xyce segfaults when it encounters an instance line for a 
non-existent device type. Blank lines at the start of the netlist 
also caused problems.
 
Procedure:
============
runxyce or xmpirun on each of the three netlists.  
 
Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce aborts with an error message for each netlist. 
 
Notes:
======
Xyce should not segfault.

extra-space.cir and bad-device-line.cir error message is related to 
missing metadata (2004.11.01).  worse-devivce-line.cir error message
is related to illegal values on the device line.

(2004.12.20 RJH) Currently, Xyce leaves zombie processes on linux_MPICH
and alpha_osf1_MPI runs.  This will be addressed in the next release (not 2.1).
ICC was tested and does not exhibit this problem.
