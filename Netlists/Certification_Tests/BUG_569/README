Version of Xyce: Release_2.1
 
Description:
============
Bug 569 noted that .STEP had stopped working for transient simulations.

.STEP was a capability that was added for the Xyce 2.0 release (barely).  
This new .STEP capability was recorded as bug # 381.   As such, there is 
already a regression test in place to test this capability.

The reason it got broken between 2.0 and 2.1 was that I never added any
regression tests for it.   (I'll make sure to do that this time).
 
Procedure:
============

Run the certification tests for bug # 381.

Verification:
=============

Use the same verification as was specified in bug # 381.  
 
Notes:
======

The output for .STEP has changed since release 2.0, so the README 
instructions for bug # 381 will be slightly different than before.

The big change in output is that now, the output for .STEP does not go 
to separate files anymore.  Each iteration of the .STEP is appended to a 
single file.  If the .PRINT format is "probe", then each .STEP iteration 
gets a new probe header.  If the .PRINT format is tecplot, then each 
iteration gets a separate ZONE, in the same file.

If the format is STD, things are just concatenated in a braindead way.

Anyway, the bug # 381 instructions will be consistent with these changes.
