The gold standard for this test was generated manually by running the
equivalent netlist in ngspice at 10 separate temperatures, then massaging
the output into a Xyce-style ".prn" file complete with header and footer.
The point of the test is to verify that Xyce now produces SPICE3F5/ngspice
compatible results for the diode at all temperatures.

If it becomes necessary to regenerate the gold standard, it should be done
by running the circuit in ngspice, not Xyce.
