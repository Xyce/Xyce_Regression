Test Name: BUG_658
Owner: Eric Rankin 
Test netlists: diode.cir
GS files:  none
Mode:  Serial 
Comparator:  none
Version of Xyce: Release_3.0
 
Description:
============
Add support for .raw file format.

This test confirms that Xyce will generate both a binary and ascii rawfile.
 
Procedure:
============
  runxyce -r ${OUT_DIR}/diode.raw diode.cir
  runxyce -r ${OUT_DIR}/diode.raw_txt -a diode.cir

Verification:
=============
  Passes if the files diode.raw and diode.raw_txt are created. 

Notes:
======
This test does not determine the validity of the rawfile's contents.  Manual
inspection of the .raw_txt and .raw headers may be helpful.
