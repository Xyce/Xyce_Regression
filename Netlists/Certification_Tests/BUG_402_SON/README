BUG 402 SON was intended to ensure that the spice 
syntax for setting device temperature:

.options temp=xxx

is correctly translated to Xyce's format:

.options device temp=xxxx

There are two versions of the test 
netlist using the two ways to specify
device temperature and both are run by the 
test script bug402son.cir.sh.  Then
the two results are compared with 
xyce_verify.
