Test netlists: rs_example.cir
GS files: none

Comparator:   none
Version of Xyce: Release_2.1  
 
Description:
============
bug 612:  Parsing netlist that redefines subcircuit causes freeze

Subcircuit names should be unique at a given level.  Xyce did not recognize
duplicates prior the fix.  Because of the way the distributed parser moves
back & forth through netlists, the potential for getting stuck in an 
infinite was there.
 
Procedure:
============
  runxyce rs_example.cir
    or
  xmpirun -np 2 rs_example.cir 

Verification:
=============
Passes if Xyce aborts with an error message about invalid subcircuit named
"DAVE".
