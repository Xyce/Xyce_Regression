Bug Number: 133
Test netlist: bug_133.cir

Description:
============
Bug 133 is a feature request for the capability to parse .OUTPUT lines
and treat them properly.

Verification
============
Run Xyce on the netlist.

Examine the output to determine whether Xyce is outputting once every
microsecond for the first 500 microseconds, and once ever 10
microseconds thereafter.  We have no automated tool that can determine
that as of Release 2.0.


Special Notes:
==============

It is incorrect to use "xyce_verify.pl" or "compare" to check this
bug.  Both of those comparators use time-smoothing techniques to get
around the variations of output interval in different codes or
versions of a single code.  Using such techniques would in fact *mask*
any failure of Xyce to treat .output and .options output lines
correctly.
