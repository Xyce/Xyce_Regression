This test is not really designed to be run in the "compare all
netlists against a gold standard with the 'compare' program" mode.  It
is intended that all netlists will be run and their output compared to
the output of test subckt_a0.cir

All of the "subckt_a?.cir" netlists should match test subckt_a0.cir
exactly.  I have tested this with xyce_verify.pl on one platform.

Because nobody's set up to work that way yet, I have provided "gold
standard" files that are actually copies of the output of
subckt_a0.cir.  When XTF reaches the stage where all developers are
using it, we should switch to the mode of running all the netlists on
one platform and comparing everything to test subckt_a0.cir.  At that
time, it would be appropriate to retain a subckt_a0.cir.prn gold
standard to be sure that that baseline test is correct.
