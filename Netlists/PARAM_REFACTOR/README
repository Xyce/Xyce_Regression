This is a directory for testing various aspects of
the parameter refactor described in bugzilla issue 1190.

The point of that issue is to make it so that .param doesn't 
have to be constant.  .global_param can already be treated as a 
variable, so the goal is to make .param more like .global_param.

With the new expression library, a lot of the necessary work
is done, but there is still work needed to make the rest of
Xyce understand this.
