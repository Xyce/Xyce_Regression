Output data in this directory was generated with SPICE 3F5 modified to support
the BSIM4 with version 4.6.1.  xyce_verify.pl should be able to cope with
gold standards in SPICE format, so long as there are not so many output
variables that SPICE starts splitting the lines (which it does in a way
that xyce_verify can't handle).
