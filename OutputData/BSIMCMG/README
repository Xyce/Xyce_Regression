The "gold standards" in this directory are not actually Xyce output.  They 
are taken from the HSpice output provided by the BSIM group along with 
the BSIM-CMG verilog files, as "circuit.lis" files.

Those original files are captures of HSpice console output, and had to be 
munged into a format that "xyce_verify.pl" could accept.  But the actual
numbers in these gold standards are the same numbers in those .lis files,
and should NOT be replaced by any Xyce output.  The goal here is to check
Xyce's output from BSIM-CMG netlists with the standard output provided by
the BSIM group.
